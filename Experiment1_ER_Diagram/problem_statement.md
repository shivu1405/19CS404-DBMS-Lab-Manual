| **Restaurant - Table**     | Restaurant (1) ↔ Table (Many)     | 1 to Many   | Restaurant: Total, Table: Partial     | Each restaurant has many tables; each table belongs to exactly one restaurant.           |

### Assumptions
Single Table per Reservation: Each reservation is linked to only one table for a specific date and time.

Menu Item Pricing: The price of a menu item can vary over time, so the price is stored with each order item to maintain historical accuracy.

Multiple Orders per Reservation: Customers can place multiple orders during a single reservation (e.g., appetizers first, then main course).
